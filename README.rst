A Python interface for the netCDF4_ file-format that reads and writes HDF5
files API directly via h5py_, without relying on the Unidata netCDF library.

Why h5netcdf?
-------------

- We've seen occasional reports of better performance with h5py than
  netCDF4-python, though in many cases performance is identical. For
  `one workflow`_, h5netcdf was reported to be almost **4x faster** than
  `netCDF4-python`_.
- It has one less massive binary dependency (netCDF C). If you already have h5py
  installed, reading netCDF4 with h5netcdf may be much easier than installing
  netCDF4-Python.
- Anecdotally, HDF5 users seem to be unexcited about switching to netCDF --
  hopefully this will convince them that the netCDF4 is actually quite sane!
- Finally, side-stepping the netCDF C library (and Cython bindings to it)
  gives us an easier way to identify the source of performance issues and
  bugs.

Install
-------

Ensure you have a recent version of h5py installed (I recommend using conda_).
At least version 2.1 is required (for dimension scales); versions 2.3 and newer
have been verified to work, though some tests only pass on h5py 2.6. Then:
``pip install h5netcdf``

.. _conda: http://conda.io/

Usage
-----

h5netcdf has two APIs, a new API and a legacy API. Both interfaces currently
reproduce most of the features of the netCDF interface, with the noteable
exceptions of:

- support for operations the rename or delete existing objects.
- suport for creating unlimited dimensions.

We simply haven't gotten around to implementing these features yet. Patches
would be very welcome.

New API
~~~~~~~

The new API supports direct hierarchical access of variables and groups. Its
design is an adaptation of h5py to the netCDF data model. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    import h5netcdf
    import numpy as np

    with h5netcdf.File('mydata.nc', 'w') as f:
        # set dimensions with a dictionary
        f.dimensions = {'x': 5}
        # and update them with a dict-like interface
        # f.dimensions['x'] = 5
        # f.dimensions.update({'x': 5})

        v = f.create_variable('hello', ('x',), float)
        v[:] = np.ones(5)

        # you don't need to create groups first
        # you also don't need to create dimensions first if you supply data
        # with the new variable
        v = f.create_variable('/grouped/data', ('y',), data=np.arange(10))

        # access and modify attributes with a dict-like interface
        v.attrs['foo'] = 'bar'

        # you can access variables and groups directly using a hierarchical
        # keys like h5py
        print(f['/grouped/data'])

Legacy API
~~~~~~~~~~

The legacy API is designed for compatibility with netCDF4-python_. To use it, import
``h5netcdf.legacyapi``:

.. _netCDF4-python: https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf4-python

.. code-block:: python

    import h5netcdf.legacyapi as netCDF4
    # everything here would also work with this instead:
    # import netCDF4
    import numpy as np

    with netCDF4.Dataset('mydata.nc', 'w') as ds:
        ds.createDimension('x', 5)
        v = ds.createVariable('hello', float, ('x',))
        v[:] = np.ones(5)

        g = ds.createGroup('grouped')
        g.createDimension('y', 10)
        g.createVariable('data', 'i8', ('y',))
        v = g['data']
        v[:] = np.arange(10)
        v.foo = 'bar'
        print(ds.groups['grouped'].variables['data'])

The legacy API is designed to be easy to try-out for netCDF4-python users, but it is not an
exact match. Here is an incomplete list of functionality we don't include:

- Utility functions ``chartostring``, ``num2date``, etc., that are not directly necessary
  for writing netCDF files.
- We don't support the ``endian`` argument to ``createVariable``. The h5py API does not
  appear to offer this feature.
- h5netcdf variables do not support automatic masking or scaling (e.g., of values matching
  the ``_FillValue`` attribute). We prefer to leave this functionality to client libraries
  (e.g., xarray_), which can implement their exact desired scaling behavior.

Change Log
----------

Version 0.3.0:

- Datasets are now loaded lazily. This should increase performance when opening
  files with a large number of groups and/or variables.
- Support for writing arrays of variable length unicode strings with `dtype=str`
  via the legacy API.
- h5netcdf now writes the _NCProperties attribute for identifying netCDF4 files.
