If you are interested to contribute, just let us know by creating an issue or pull request on github.

Contribution Guidelines
-----------------------

- New features and changes should be added via Pull Requests from forks for contributors as well as maintainers.
- Pull Requests should have at least one approval (once the maintainer count has increased).
- Self merges without approval are allowed for repository maintenance, hotfixes and if the code changes do not affect functionality.
- Directly pushing to the repository main branch should only be used as a last resort.
- Releases should be introduced via Pull Request and approved. Exception: Patch release after hotfix.

Continuous Integration
----------------------

``h5netcdf`` uses GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration (CI). On every ``push`` to a repository branch
or a PullRequest branch several checks are performed:

- Lint and style checks (``ruff``, ``black``)
- Unit tests with latest ``h5py3`` (Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11) facilitating GitHub Ubuntu worker
- Documentation build, artifacts are made available to download
- On release, source-tarball and universal wheel is uploaded to PyPI and documentation is made available
  on `h5netcdf GitHub Pages`_

Documentation
-------------

The documentation, located in ``doc``-folder, can be created using ``sphinx-doc`` and the ``sphinx-book_theme``::

    $ cd doc
    $ make html

The rendered documentation is then available in the subfolder ``_build``.

Due to the history several documents, eg. `README.rst`_ and `CHANGELOG.rst`_, are located in the project's root folder.
They are linked into the documentation via ``.. include``-directive. Links and cross-references originating from these files
should be hardcoded to maintain operation also in non-rendered format.

.. _README.rst: https://github.com/h5netcdf/h5netcdf/blob/main/README.rst
.. _CHANGELOG.rst: https://github.com/h5netcdf/h5netcdf/blob/main/CHANGELOG.rst

Release Workflow
----------------

1. Create release commit (can be done per PullRequest for more visibility)
    * versioning is done via `setuptools_scm`
    * update CHANGELOG.rst if necessary
    * add/update sections to README.rst (or documentation) if necessary
    * check all needed dependencies are listed in setup.py
2. Create release
    * draft `new github release`_
    * tag version (eg `v1.2.0`) `@ Target: main`
    * set release title (eg. `release 1.2.0`)
    * add release description (eg. `bugfix-release`), tbd.

This will start the CI workflow once again. The workflow creates `sdist` and universal `wheel` and uploads it to PyPI.

netCDF4-python quirks:

- ``_Netcdf4Dimid`` gets attached to all data variables if a 2D coordinate variable is created  and any variable is written/file is reopened for append, see `issue 1104`_
- unlimited variable dimensions are reported as current size of the dimension scale, even if the variable's underlying ``DATASPACE`` dimension is smaller (eg. 0)
