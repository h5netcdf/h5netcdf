h5netcdf: A Python interface for the netCDF4 file-format based on h5py
======================================================================

:Release: |release|
:Date: |today|

**h5netcdf** is an open source project and Python package that provides an interface
for the `netCDF4 file-format`_ that reads and writes local or remote HDF5 files directly
via `h5py`_ or `h5pyd`_, without relying on the Unidata netCDF library.

History
-------

The project was started in early 2015. The first commit was made on 7th of April in 2015
by Stephan Hoyer. The first `official` ``h5netcdf`` announcement was made by Stephan on the
`xarray issue tracker`_ only one day later.

The library evolved constantly over the years (fixing bugs and adding enhancements)
and gained contributions from 15 other :ref:`contributors` so far. The library is widely used,
especially as backend within `xarray`_.

Early 2020 Kai MÃ¼hlbauer started to add contributions and after some time he volunteered
to help in maintaining ``h5netcdf``. Two years later in January 2022 Stephan handed the
project-lead over to Kai. ``h5netcdf`` version 1.0 was released on 31st of March 2022.
